# Novusk - ARM kernel capabilities and information

---

What the ARM kernel as capable of doing is based off how much support there is for the device it's running on. 
Generally the ARM kernel can: setup early CPU functions, handle memory allocation, basic IRQs, "system calls" 
(not proper ones), and most devices have mailbox support (firmware interface).
